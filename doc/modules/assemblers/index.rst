Output assemblers (:py:mod:`indra_world.assemblers`)
====================================================

As opposed to INDRA, the importance of output/model assemblers in INDRA World
is minor, since other systems such as Delphi (https://github.com/ml4ai/delphi)
and DySE (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359115.3359123) take on the role
of converting assembled INDRA Statements into probabilistic and logical
dynamical models, respectively.
