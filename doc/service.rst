World Modelers INDRA service stack
==================================

.. _wm-service-endpoints:

Using the services
------------------
Below, SERVICE_HOST should be replaced by the address of the server on which
the services are running.

Check that the service is running:

.. code-block:: sh

    URL: http://SERVICE_HOST:8001/health
    Method: GET
    Output: {"state": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}


Read a given text with a reader and return INDRA Statements (below, <reader>
can be eidos, sofia or cwms). Note that for `eidos` specifically, a
`webservice` parameter should also be passed which points to the address
on which the Eidos web service is running (see above):

.. code-block:: sh

    URL: http://SERVICE_HOST:8000/<reader>/process_text
    Method: POST with JSON content header
    Input parameters: {"text": "rainfall causes floods"}
    Output: {}

Submit curations for a set of Statements in a corpus:

.. code-block:: sh

    URL: http://SERVICE_HOST:8001/submit_curations
    Method: POST with JSON content header
    Input parameters: {"corpus_id": "<corpus-id>", "curations": [<curations>]}
    Output: {}

Save curations for a given corpus on S3:

.. code-block:: sh

    URL: http://SERVICE_HOST:8001/save_curations
    Method: POST with JSON content header
    Input parameters: {"corpus_id": "<corpus-id>"}
    Output: {}

Update beliefs of a corpus:

.. code-block:: sh

    URL: http://SERVICE_HOST:8001/update_beliefs
    Method: POST with JSON content header
    Input parameters: {"corpus_id": "<corpus-id>"}
    Output: {"38ce0c14-2c7e-4df8-bd53-3006afeaa193": 0,
     "6f2b2d69-16af-40ea-aa03-9b3a9a1d2ac3": 0.6979166666666666,
     "727adb95-4890-4bbc-a985-fd985c355215": 0.6979166666666666}

Reset all submitted curations so far:

.. code-block:: sh

    URL: http://SERVICE_HOST:8001/reset_curation
    Method: POST with JSON content header
    Input parameters: {}
    Output: {}

Re-assemble corpus for a given project based on curations and dump the results
on S3.

.. code-block:: sh

    URL: http://SERVICE_HOST:8001/run_assembly
    Method: POST with JSON content header
    Input parameters: {"corpus_id": "<corpus_id>", "project_id": "<project_id>"}
    Output: {}

Download curations and the corresponding curated statements for a corpus.
If a reader name is provided, filter the results to curations for statements
that have the provided reader among its sources, otherwise all curations and
their corresponding statements are returned.

.. code-block:: sh

    URL: http://SERVICE_HOST:8001/download_curation
    Method: POST with JSON content header
    Input parameters: {"corpus_id": "1", "reader": "<reader name>"}
    Output: {"curations": [<curations>],
             "statements": {"38ce0c14-2c7e-4df8-bd53-3006afeaa193": <stmt_json>}}

Notify INDRA of a new reader output in DART.

.. code-block:: sh

    URL: http://SERVICE_HOST:8001/notify
    Method: POST with JSON content header
    Input parameters: {"identity": "eidos",
                       "version": "3.1.4",
                       "document_id": "38ce0c14-2c7e-4df8-bd53-3006afeaa193",

    Output: {}


.. _wm-service-s3:
INDRA assemblies on S3
----------------------
Access to the INDRA-assembled corpora requires credentails to the shared
World Modelers S3 bucket "world-modelers". Each INDRA-assembled corpus is
available within this bucket, under the "indra_models" key base. Each corpus
is identified by a string identifier ("corpus_id" in the requests above).

The corpus index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The list of corpora can be obtained either using S3's list objects function
or by reading the index.csv file which is maintained by INDRA. This index
is a comma separated values text file which contains one row for each corpus.
Each row's first element is a corpus identifier, and the second element
is the UTC date-time at which the corpus was uploaded to S3. An example
row in this file looks as follows

.. code-block:: sh

    test1_newlines,2020-05-08-22-34-29

where test1_newlines is the corpus identifier and 2020-05-08-22-34-29 is the
upload date-time.

Structure of each corpus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Within the world-modelers bucket, under the indra_models key base, files
for each corpus are organized under a subkey equivalent to the corpus
identifier, for instance, all the files for the test1_newlines corpus
are under the indra_models/test1_newlines/ key base. The list of files
for each corpus are as follows

- `statements.json`: a JSON dump of assembled INDRA Statements. As of May 2020,
  each statement's JSON representation is on a separate line in this file.
  Any corpus uploaded before that has a standard JSON structure. This is the
  main file that CauseMos needs to ingest for UI interaction.

- `raw_statements.json`: a JSON dump of raw INDRA Statements. This file is
  typically not needed in downstream usage, however, the INDRA curation
  service needs to have access to it for internal assembly tasks.

- `metadata.json`: a JSON file containing key-value pairs that describe the
  corpus. The standard keys in this file are as follows:

  - `description`: a human-readable description of how the corpus was obtained.
  - `display_name`: a human-readable display name for the corpus.
  - `readers`: a list of the names of the reading systems from which
    statements were obtained in the corpus.
  - `assembly`: a dictionary identifying attributes of the assembly process with
    the following keys:

      - `level`: the level of resolution used to assemble the corpus
        (e.g., "location_and_time").
      - `grounding_threshold`: the threshold (if any) which was used to filter
        statements by grounding score (e.g., 0.7)

  - `num_statements`: the number of assembled INDRA Statements in the corpus (
    i.e., statements.json).
  - `num_documents`: the number of documents that were read by readers to
    produce the statements that were assembled.

  Note that any of these keys may be missing if unavailable, for instance,
  in the case of old uploads.

- `curations.json`: a JSON file which persists curations as collected by INDRA.
  This is the basis of surfacing reader-specific curations in the
  download_curation endpoint (see above).


.. _wm-service-local-setup:

Setting up the services locally
-------------------------------
These instructions describe setting up and using the INDRA service stack
for World Modelers applications, in particular, as a back-end for the
CauseMos UI.

The instructions below run each Docker container with the :code:`-d` option
which will run containers in the background. You can list running containers
with their ids using :code:`docker ps` and stop a container with
:code:`docker stop <container id>`.

Setting up the Eidos service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clone the Eidos repo and cd to the Docker folder

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/clulab/eidos.git
    cd eidos/Docker

Build the Eidos docker image

.. code-block:: sh

    docker build -f DockerfileRunProd . -t eidos-webservice

Run the Eidos web service and expose it on port 9000

.. code-block:: sh

    docker run -id -p 9000:9000 eidos-webservice


Setting up the general INDRA service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pull the INDRA docker image from DockerHub

.. code-block:: sh

    docker pull labsyspharm/indra

Run the INDRA web service and expose it on port 8000

.. code-block:: sh

    docker run -id -p 8000:8080 --entrypoint gunicorn labsyspharm/indra:latest \
        -w 1 -b :8000 -t 600 rest_api.api:app

Note that the :code:`-w 1` parameter specifies one service worker which can
be set to a higher number if needed.

Setting up the INDRA live curation service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Assuming you already have the INDRA docker image, run the INDRA live
feedback service with the following parameters:

.. code-block:: sh

    docker run -id -p 8001:8001 --env-file docker_variables --entrypoint \
    python labsyspharm/indra /sw/indra/indra/tools/live_curation/live_curation.py

Here we use the tag :code:`--env-file` to provide a file containing
environment variables to the docker. In this case, we need to provide
:code:`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and :code:`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to allow the
curation service to access World Modelers corpora on S3.
The file content should look like this:

.. code-block:: sh

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<aws_access_key_id>
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws_secret_access_key>

Replace :code:`<aws_access_key_id>` and :code:`<aws_secret_access_key>` with
your aws access and secret keys.
